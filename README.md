# Identifying Bot Tweets: Political and Nonpolitical Contexts
by William Johnson and Andrew Hatfield

This repository provides the data files (filled with tweets), configuration files to run the experiments with NLP Scholar, scripts to run the config files with Turing, and associated results files for this project.

*Note that the original datasets cannot be added both because they are too large and contain legally protected data.
Bot tweets labeled as political or nonpolitical come from [Tweets and Social Network Data for Twitter Bot Analysis](https://sbp-brims.org/2021/papers/working-papers/2021_SBP-BRiMS_FinalPDF_57.pdf) made by Golbeck et al (2021). Human and bot tweets (without a political/nonpolitical designation) come from the [Twitter-Bot-Detection Database](https://github.com/rrsr28/Twitter-Bot-Detection/blob/main/Twitter_Bot_Detection.ipynb) produced by the user rrsr28 on Github.
